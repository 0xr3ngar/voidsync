VoidSync is a terminal-based CLI tool that liberates your music from platform silos. Connect your Spotify and YouTube accounts, select your favorite playlists, and watch them seamlessly migrate to YouTube Music—all from the comfort of your terminal.

**Current Features:**
- ✅ Migrate playlists from Spotify to YouTube Music
- ✅ Automatic track matching and search
- ✅ Real-time progress tracking
- ✅ Beautiful terminal UI

No more manually recreating playlists. No more switching between apps. Just pure, void-crushing synchronization.

## Prerequisites

Before installing VoidSync, you'll need to set up API credentials for the platforms you want to sync:

### Google/YouTube API Setup

1. Visit the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
2. Create a new project (or select an existing one)
3. Enable the **YouTube Data API v3**
4. Go to **Credentials** → **Create Credentials** → **OAuth 2.0 Client ID**
5. Configure the OAuth consent screen
6. Add `http://localhost:3000/callback` as an authorized redirect URI
7. Save your **Client ID** and **Client Secret**

### Spotify API Setup

1. Visit the [Spotify Developer Dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard)
2. Log in and create a new app
3. Add `http://localhost:3000/callback` as a redirect URI
4. Save your **Client ID** and **Client Secret**

### Runtime Requirements

* **Bun** 1.0+ ([Install Bun](https://bun.sh))
* **macOS** or **Linux** (Windows support via WSL)

## 📦 Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/0xr3ngar/voidsync.git
cd voidsync

# Install dependencies
bun install

# Build the CLI
bun run build

bun link
```

## ⚙️ Configuration

Create a `.env` file in the root directory with your API credentials:

```env
# YouTube/Google OAuth Credentials
YOUTUBE_CLIENT_ID=your_google_client_id_here
YOUTUBE_CLIENT_SECRET=your_google_client_secret_here
YOUTUBE_REDIRECT_URI=http://localhost:3000/callback

# Spotify OAuth Credentials
SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID=your_spotify_client_id_here
SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET=your_spotify_client_secret_here
SPOTIFY_REDIRECT_URI=http://localhost:3000/callback
```

## 🚀 Usage

```bash
voidsync
```

### How It Works

1. **Intro Animation** - Watch the void-conquering journey unfold
2. **Platform Authentication** - Connect your Spotify and YouTube accounts via OAuth
   - Use `↑` and `↓` arrow keys to navigate
   - Press `SPACE` to authenticate a platform
   - Press `ENTER` to continue once both platforms are authenticated
3. **Playlist Selection** - Choose which Spotify playlists to migrate
   - Navigate through your Spotify playlists
   - Select the ones you want to sync to YouTube Music
4. **Migration Progress** - Watch your playlists migrate to YouTube Music in real-time
   - See each track being searched and added
   - Get a clickable link to your new YouTube Music playlist when complete

## Development

# Start in development mode with hot reload
bun run dev

# Run tests
bun test

# Run type checking
bun run typecheck
